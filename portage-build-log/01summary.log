WARN: postinst
Some software with pre-loaded PAM libraries might experience
warnings or failures related to missing symbols and/or versions
after any update. While unfortunate this is a limit of the
implementation of PAM and the software, and it requires you to
restart the software manually after the update.
You can get a list of such software running a command like
  lsof / | grep -E -i 'del.*libpam\.so'
Alternatively, simply reboot your system.
