    - dev-libs/intel-compute-runtime:legacy - integrated Intel GPUs from Gen8 up to Gen11. 64-bit only;
    - dev-libs/pocl - to run OpenCL programs on your CPU, if you do not have a supported GPU;
    - dev-libs/rocm-opencl-runtime - AMD GPUs supported by the amdgpu kernel driver. 64-bit only;
    - media-libs/mesa[opencl] - some older AMD GPUs; see [1]. 32-bit support;

 * proprietary:
    - dev-libs/amdgpu-pro-opencl - AMD Polaris GPUs. 32-bit support;

WARN: postinst
Some software with pre-loaded PAM libraries might experience
warnings or failures related to missing symbols and/or versions
after any update. While unfortunate this is a limit of the
implementation of PAM and the software, and it requires you to
restart the software manually after the update.

You can get a list of such software running a command like
  lsof / | grep -E -i 'del.*libpam\.so'

Alternatively, simply reboot your system.

Boost.Regex is *extremely* ABI sensitive. If you get errors such as

  undefined reference to `boost::re_detail_108800::cpp_regex_traits_implementation

Then you need to recompile Boost and all its reverse dependencies

To use Docker, the Docker daemon must be running as root. To automatically
start the Docker daemon at boot:
  rc-update add docker default

To use Docker as a non-root user, add yourself to the 'docker' group:

Install additional packages for optional runtime features:
  sys-apps/rootlesskit for rootless mode support
for rootless mode you also need a network stack

LOG: postinst
You have enabled bluetooth USE flag for pulseaudio. Daemon will now handle
bluetooth Headset (HSP HS and HSP AG) and Handsfree (HFP HF) profiles using
native headset backend by default. This can be selectively disabled
via runtime configuration arguments to module-bluetooth-discover
in /etc/pulse/default.pa
To disable HFP HF append enable_native_hfp_hf=false
To disable HSP HS append enable_native_hsp_hs=false
To disable HSP AG append headset=auto or headset=ofono
(note this does NOT require enabling USE ofono)

GStreamer-based RTP implementation modile enabled.
To use OPUS payload install media-plugins/gst-plugins-opus
and add enable_opus=1 argument to module-rtp-send
