If upgrading from a version prior to 0.17.0, you will need to move
your configuration from ~/.elinks to ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/elinks

You may want to convert your html.cfg and links.cfg of
Links or older ELinks versions to the new ELinks elinks.conf
using /usr/share/doc/elinks-0.18.0/contrib/conv/conf-links2elinks.pl

Please have a look at /etc/elinks/keybind-full.sample and
/etc/elinks/keybind.conf.sample for some bindings examples.

You will have to set your TERM variable to 'xterm-256color'
to be able to use 256 colors in elinks.

LOG: postinst
On many systems, especially amd64, it is typical that with a modern
toolchain -fomit-frame-pointer for gcc is the default, because
debugging is still possible thanks to gcc4/gdb location list feature.
However sysprof is not able to construct call trees if frame pointers
are not present. Therefore -fno-omit-frame-pointer CFLAGS is suggested
for the libraries and applications involved in the profiling. That
means a CPU register is used for the frame pointer instead of other
purposes, which means a very minimal performance loss when there is
register pressure.

In order to take advantage of OpenCL you will need a runtime for your hardware.
Currently included in Gentoo are:

 * open:
    - dev-libs/intel-compute-runtime - integrated Intel GPUs from Gen12 onwards. 64-bit only;
    - dev-libs/intel-compute-runtime:legacy - integrated Intel GPUs from Gen8 up to Gen11. 64-bit only;
    - dev-libs/pocl - to run OpenCL programs on your CPU, if you do not have a supported GPU;
    - dev-libs/rocm-opencl-runtime - AMD GPUs supported by the amdgpu kernel driver. 64-bit only;
    - media-libs/mesa[opencl] - some older AMD GPUs; see [1]. 32-bit support;

 * proprietary:
    - dev-libs/amdgpu-pro-opencl - AMD Polaris GPUs. 32-bit support;
    - dev-util/intel-ocl-sdk - Intel CPUs (*not* GPUs). 64-bit only;
    - x11-drivers/nvidia-drivers - Nvidia GPUs; specific package versions
      required for older devices [2]. 32-bit support.
