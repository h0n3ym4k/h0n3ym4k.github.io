WARN: postinst
The window title setting behaviour has been improved. It is now formatted as "\u@\h \W", in accordance with the prompting mechanism of bash. For example, after switching to the home directory,
the current working directly will be shown as the <tilde> character.

The value of PROMPT_DIRTRIM is now respected. If this variable is unset, the use of the \W prompt string escape will prevail, with the current working directory typically being shown as its
basename. If set to 0 or greater, \w will be used instead, which may be trimmed. This also means that the title can be made to show the full path by setting PROMPT_DIRTRIM=0.

For further information, run info '(bash)Bash Variables' or visit https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#index-PROMPT_005fDIRTRIM.

QA: prepare
QA Notice: Compatibility with CMake < 3.5 has been removed from CMake 4,
media-libs/sdl2-ttf will fail to build w/o a fix.
See also tracker bug #951350; check existing bug or file a new one for
this package, and take it upstream.

The following CMakeLists.txt files are causing errors:
  external/freetype/CMakeLists.txt:3.0

Compatibility with CMake < 3.10 will be removed in a future release.
If not fixed in upstream's code repository, we should make sure they are aware.
See also tracker bug #964405; check existing or file a new bug for this package.

CMake 4 detected; building with -DCMAKE_POLICY_VERSION_MINIMUM=3.5
This is merely a workaround to avoid CMake Error and *not* a permanent fix;
there may be new build or runtime bugs as a result.

An upstreamable patch should take any resulting CMake policy changes
into account. See also:
