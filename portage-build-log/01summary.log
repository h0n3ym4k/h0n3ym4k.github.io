ERROR: preinst
This package will overwrite one or more files that may belong to other
packages (see list below). You can use a command such as `portageq
owners / <filename>` to identify the installed package that owns a
file. If portageq reports that only one package owns a file then do
NOT file a bug report. A bug report is only useful if it identifies at
least two or more packages that are known to install the same file(s).
If a collision occurs and you can not explain where the file came from
then you should simply ignore the collision since there is not enough
information to determine if a real problem exists. Please do NOT file
a bug report at https://bugs.gentoo.org/ unless you report exactly
which two packages install the same file(s). See
https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Knowledge_Base:Blockers for tips on how
to solve the problem. And once again, please do NOT file a bug report
unless you have completely understood the above message.
