WARN: preinst
UPDATE THE PERL MODULES:
After updating dev-lang/perl the installed Perl modules
have to be re-installed. In most cases, this is done automatically
by the package manager, but subsequent steps are still recommended
to ensure system consistency.

You should start with a depclean to remove any unused perl dependencies
that may confuse portage in future. Regular depcleans are also encouraged
as part of your regular update cycle, as that will keep perl upgrades working.
Recommended: emerge --depclean -va

You should then call perl-cleaner to clean up any old files and trigger any
remaining rebuilds portage may have missed.
Use: perl-cleaner --all

Valgrind will not work if libc (e.g. glibc) does not have debug symbols.
To fix this you can add splitdebug to FEATURES in make.conf
