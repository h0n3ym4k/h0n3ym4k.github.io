WARN: postinst
Switch to WirePlumber will happen the next time gentoo-pipewire-launcher
is started (a replacement for directly calling pipewire binary).

Please ensure that /etc/pipewire/pipewire.conf either does not exist
or, if it does exist, that any reference to
/usr/bin/pipewire-media-session is commented out (begins with a #).

LOG: postinst
On many systems, especially amd64, it is typical that with a modern
toolchain -fomit-frame-pointer for gcc is the default, because
debugging is still possible thanks to gcc4/gdb location list feature.
However sysprof is not able to construct call trees if frame pointers
are not present. Therefore -fno-omit-frame-pointer CFLAGS is suggested
for the libraries and applications involved in the profiling. That
means a CPU register is used for the frame pointer instead of other
purposes, which means a very minimal performance loss when there is
register pressure.
