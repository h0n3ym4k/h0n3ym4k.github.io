WARN: postinst
Switch to WirePlumber will happen the next time gentoo-pipewire-launcher
is started (a replacement for directly calling pipewire binary).

Please ensure that /etc/pipewire/pipewire.conf either does not exist
or, if it does exist, that any reference to
/usr/bin/pipewire-media-session is commented out (begins with a #).
