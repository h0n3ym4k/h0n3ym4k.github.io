future release. If you need this functionality, install
app-containers/docker-buildx.

WARN: postinst
Some software with pre-loaded PAM libraries might experience
warnings or failures related to missing symbols and/or versions
after any update. While unfortunate this is a limit of the
implementation of PAM and the software, and it requires you to
restart the software manually after the update.

You can get a list of such software running a command like
  lsof / | grep -E -i 'del.*libpam\.so'

Alternatively, simply reboot your system.

LOG: postinst
If you wish to enable the firewall rules on boot (on openrc) you
will need to enable the nftables service.
    'rc-update add nftables default'

If you are creating or updating the firewall rules and wish to save
them to be loaded on the next restart, use the "save" functionality
in the init script.
    'rc-service nftables save'

LOG: setup
Your USB printers will be managed via libusb. In case you run into problems, 
please try disabling USB_PRINTER support in your kernel or blacklisting the
usblp kernel module.
Alternatively, just disable the usb useflag for cups (your printer will still work).

To use Docker, the Docker daemon must be running as root. To automatically
start the Docker daemon at boot:
  rc-update add docker default

To use Docker as a non-root user, add yourself to the 'docker' group:
  usermod -aG docker <youruser>

Install additional packages for optional runtime features:
  sys-apps/rootlesskit for rootless mode support
for rootless mode you also need a network stack
  app-containers/slirp4netns for rootless mode network stack
