Attention: cgi and cgid modules are now handled via APACHE2_MODULES flags
in make.conf. Make sure to enable those in order to compile them.
In general, you should use 'cgid' with threaded MPMs and 'cgi' otherwise.
WARN: postinst
Attention: The tls module based on rustls-ffi has been moved to its own package.
emerge www-apache/mod_tls to continue using the tls module.

WARN: postinst
Some software with pre-loaded PAM libraries might experience
warnings or failures related to missing symbols and/or versions
after any update. While unfortunate this is a limit of the
implementation of PAM and the software, and it requires you to
restart the software manually after the update.

You can get a list of such software running a command like
  lsof / | grep -E -i 'del.*libpam\.so'

Alternatively, simply reboot your system.
