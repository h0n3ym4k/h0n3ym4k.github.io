UPDATE THE PERL MODULES:
After updating dev-lang/perl to a new major version the installed Perl modules
have to be re-installed. In most cases, this is done automatically
by the package manager.
ONLY if you encounter problems, call perl-cleaner to clean up any old files
and trigger any remaining rebuilds portage may have missed.
Use: perl-cleaner --all

WARN: postinst
Some software with pre-loaded PAM libraries might experience
warnings or failures related to missing symbols and/or versions
after any update. While unfortunate this is a limit of the
implementation of PAM and the software, and it requires you to
restart the software manually after the update.
You can get a list of such software running a command like
  lsof / | grep -E -i 'del.*libpam\.so'
Alternatively, simply reboot your system.
