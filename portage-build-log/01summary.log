This software has a massive number of options that
are configurable and it is *impossible* for all of
those to fit inside any manageable ebuild.
The Gentoo provided package has enough to build
a fully optimized library for your targeted CPU.
You can set the CPU target using the environment
variable - OPENBLAS_TARGET or it will be detected
automatically from the target toolchain (supports
cross compilation toolchains).
You can control the maximum number of threads
using OPENBLAS_NTHREAD, default=64 and number of 
parallel calls to allow before further calls wait
using OPENBLAS_NPARALLEL, default=8.

Valgrind will not work if libc (e.g. glibc) does not have debug symbols.
