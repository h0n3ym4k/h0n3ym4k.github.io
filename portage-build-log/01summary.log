To use Docker, the Docker daemon must be running as root. To automatically
start the Docker daemon at boot:
  rc-update add docker default

To use Docker as a non-root user, add yourself to the 'docker' group:
  usermod -aG docker <youruser>

Install additional packages for optional runtime features:
  sys-apps/rootlesskit for rootless mode support
for rootless mode you also need a network stack
