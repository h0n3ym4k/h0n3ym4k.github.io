You can manipulate several configure options of suexec
through the following environment variables:

 SUEXEC_SAFEPATH: Default PATH for suexec (default: '/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin')
   SUEXEC_CALLER: Name of the user Apache is running as (default: apache)
  SUEXEC_DOCROOT: Directory in which suexec will run scripts (default: '/var/www')
   SUEXEC_MINUID: Minimum UID, which is allowed to run scripts via suexec (default: 1000)
   SUEXEC_MINGID: Minimum GID, which is allowed to run scripts via suexec (default: 100)
  SUEXEC_USERDIR: User subdirectories (like /home/user/html) (default: public_html)
    SUEXEC_UMASK: Umask for the suexec process (default: 077)

Please note that you need SysV IPC support in your kernel.
Make sure CONFIG_SYSVIPC=y is set.

LOG: postinst
Attention: cgi and cgid modules are now handled via APACHE2_MODULES flags
in make.conf. Make sure to enable those in order to compile them.
In general, you should use 'cgid' with threaded MPMs and 'cgi' otherwise.

QA Notice: One or more empty directories installed to /var:

  /var/run
  /var/www

If those directories need to be preserved, please make sure to create
or mark them for keeping using 'keepdir'. Portage for >= EAPI 8 ebuilds
will strip empty directories from installation image.

WARN: postinst
Some software with pre-loaded PAM libraries might experience
warnings or failures related to missing symbols and/or versions
after any update. While unfortunate this is a limit of the
implementation of PAM and the software, and it requires you to
restart the software manually after the update.

You can get a list of such software running a command like
  lsof / | grep -E -i 'del.*libpam\.so'

Alternatively, simply reboot your system.

    - dev-libs/pocl - to run OpenCL programs on your CPU, if you do not have a supported GPU;
    - dev-libs/rocm-opencl-runtime - AMD GPUs supported by the amdgpu kernel driver. 64-bit only;
    - media-libs/mesa[opencl] - some older AMD GPUs; see [1]. 32-bit support;

 * proprietary:
    - dev-libs/amdgpu-pro-opencl - AMD Polaris GPUs. 32-bit support;
    - dev-util/intel-ocl-sdk - Intel CPUs (*not* GPUs). 64-bit only;
    - x11-drivers/nvidia-drivers[uvm] - Nvidia GPUs; specific package versions

LOG: postinst
On many systems, especially amd64, it is typical that with a modern
toolchain -fomit-frame-pointer for gcc is the default, because
debugging is still possible thanks to gcc4/gdb location list feature.
However sysprof is not able to construct call trees if frame pointers
are not present. Therefore -fno-omit-frame-pointer CFLAGS is suggested
for the libraries and applications involved in the profiling. That
means a CPU register is used for the frame pointer instead of other
purposes, which means a very minimal performance loss when there is
register pressure.

eselect gnome-shell-extensions manages the system default value of
the org.gnome.shell enabled-extensions key. To override the default
for an individual user, use the gsettings command, e.g.
$ gsettings set org.gnome.shell enabled-extensions "['foo', 'bar']"
To undo per-user changes and use the system default, do
$ gsettings reset org.gnome.shell enabled-extensions
