WARN: postinst
As of version 3.9, locale-gen(8) only supports locale/charmap pairs that are
officially supported by glibc itself. For most users, there should be no
impact. Nevertheless, if running locale-gen(8) raises errors regarding
unsupported combinations, it will be necessary to modify its config file.
The locale.gen(5) man page explains how to determine which are supported.

ERROR: preinst
This package will overwrite one or more files that may belong to other
packages (see list below). You can use a command such as `portageq
owners / <filename>` to identify the installed package that owns a
file. If portageq reports that only one package owns a file then do
NOT file a bug report. A bug report is only useful if it identifies at
least two or more packages that are known to install the same file(s).
If a collision occurs and you can not explain where the file came from
then you should simply ignore the collision since there is not enough
information to determine if a real problem exists. Please do NOT file
a bug report at https://bugs.gentoo.org/ unless you report exactly
which two packages install the same file(s). See
https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Knowledge_Base:Blockers for tips on how
to solve the problem. And once again, please do NOT file a bug report
unless you have completely understood the above message.

Detected file collision(s):

	/usr/bin/gpgv
	/usr/bin/gpg

WARN: preinst
None of the installed packages claim the file(s).

Package 'app-alternatives/gpg-0-r2' merged despite file collisions. If
necessary, refer to your elog messages for the whole content of the
above message.
