You may want to convert your html.cfg and links.cfg of
Links or older ELinks versions to the new ELinks elinks.conf
using /usr/share/doc/elinks-0.16.1.1-r4/contrib/conv/conf-links2elinks.pl

Please have a look at /etc/elinks/keybind-full.sample and
/etc/elinks/keybind.conf.sample for some bindings examples.

You will have to set your TERM variable to 'xterm-256color'
to be able to use 256 colors in elinks.
