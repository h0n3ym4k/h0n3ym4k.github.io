WARN: postinst
Files under /etc/bash/bashrc.d must now have a suffix of .sh or .bash.

Gentoo now defaults to defining PROMPT_COMMAND as an array. Depending on the
characteristics of the operating environment, it may contain a command to set
the terminal's window title. Those who were already choosing to customise the
PROMPT_COMMAND variable are now advised to append their commands like so:

PROMPT_COMMAND+=('custom command goes here')

Gentoo no longer defaults to having bash set the window title in the case
that the terminal is controlled by sshd(8), unless screen is launched on the
remote side or the terminal reliably supports saving and restoring the title
(as alacritty, foot and tmux do). Those wanting for the title to be set
regardless may adjust ~/.bashrc - or create a custom /etc/bash/bashrc.d
drop-in - to set PROMPT_COMMMAND like so:

PROMPT_COMMAND=(genfun_set_win_title)

Those who would prefer for bash never to interfere with the window title may
now opt out of the default title setting behaviour, either with the "unset -v
PROMPT_COMMAND" command or by re-defining PROMPT_COMMAND as desired.

Your USB printers will be managed via libusb. In case you run into problems, 
please try disabling USB_PRINTER support in your kernel or blacklisting the
usblp kernel module.
Alternatively, just disable the usb useflag for cups (your printer will still work).
