In order to take advantage of OpenCL you will need a runtime for your hardware.
Currently included in Gentoo are:

 * open:
    - dev-libs/intel-compute-runtime - integrated Intel GPUs from Gen12 onwards. 64-bit only;
    - dev-libs/intel-compute-runtime:legacy - integrated Intel GPUs from Gen8 up to Gen11. 64-bit only;
    - dev-libs/pocl - to run OpenCL programs on your CPU, if you do not have a supported GPU;
    - dev-libs/rocm-opencl-runtime - AMD GPUs supported by the amdgpu kernel driver. 64-bit only;
    - media-libs/mesa[opencl] - some older AMD GPUs; see [1]. 32-bit support;

 * proprietary:
    - dev-libs/amdgpu-pro-opencl - AMD Polaris GPUs. 32-bit support;
    - dev-util/intel-ocl-sdk - Intel CPUs (*not* GPUs). 64-bit only;
    - x11-drivers/nvidia-drivers - Nvidia GPUs; specific package versions
      required for older devices [2]. 32-bit support.
