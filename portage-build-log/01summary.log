Be warned that packages built using this version of nv-codec-headers
will require x11-drivers/nvidia-drivers of version 530.41.03 or
higher for NVDEC/NVENC to function properly. If switch to an older
nv-codec-headers version, remember to rebuild packages that are using
this such as ffmpeg or mpv.

QA Notice: Compatibility with CMake < 3.10 will be removed in a future release.
If not fixed in upstream's code repository, we should make sure they are aware.
See also tracker bug #964405; check existing or file a new bug for this package.

The following CMakeLists.txt files are causing warnings:
  CMakeLists.txt:3.5

An upstreamable patch should take any resulting CMake policy changes
into account. See also:

To use Docker, the Docker daemon must be running as root. To automatically
start the Docker daemon at boot:
  rc-update add docker default

To use Docker as a non-root user, add yourself to the 'docker' group:
  usermod -aG docker <youruser>

Install additional packages for optional runtime features:
  sys-apps/rootlesskit for rootless mode support
for rootless mode you also need a network stack
  app-containers/slirp4netns for rootless mode network stack

QA Notice: Compatibility with CMake < 3.5 has been removed from CMake 4,
media-libs/sdl2-ttf will fail to build w/o a fix.
See also tracker bug #951350; check existing bug or file a new one for
this package, and take it upstream.

The following CMakeLists.txt files are causing errors:
  external/freetype/CMakeLists.txt:3.0

Compatibility with CMake < 3.10 will be removed in a future release.
If not fixed in upstream's code repository, we should make sure they are aware.
See also tracker bug #964405; check existing or file a new bug for this package.

CMake 4 detected; building with -DCMAKE_POLICY_VERSION_MINIMUM=3.5
This is merely a workaround to avoid CMake Error and *not* a permanent fix;
there may be new build or runtime bugs as a result.

An upstreamable patch should take any resulting CMake policy changes
into account. See also:

You can manipulate several configure options of suexec
through the following environment variables:

 SUEXEC_SAFEPATH: Default PATH for suexec (default: '/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin')
   SUEXEC_CALLER: Name of the user Apache is running as (default: apache)
  SUEXEC_DOCROOT: Directory in which suexec will run scripts (default: '/var/www')
   SUEXEC_MINUID: Minimum UID, which is allowed to run scripts via suexec (default: 1000)
   SUEXEC_MINGID: Minimum GID, which is allowed to run scripts via suexec (default: 100)
  SUEXEC_USERDIR: User subdirectories (like /home/user/html) (default: public_html)
    SUEXEC_UMASK: Umask for the suexec process (default: 077)

Please note that you need SysV IPC support in your kernel.
Make sure CONFIG_SYSVIPC=y is set.

Attention: cgi and cgid modules are now handled via APACHE2_MODULES flags
in make.conf. Make sure to enable those in order to compile them.
In general, you should use 'cgid' with threaded MPMs and 'cgi' otherwise.
WARN: postinst
Attention: The tls module based on rustls-ffi has been moved to its own package.
emerge www-apache/mod_tls to continue using the tls module.
