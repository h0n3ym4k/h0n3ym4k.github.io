See /etc/sub{uid,gid} to check whether rootless user is already
configured
If not, quickly configure it with:

usermod --add-subgids 1065536-1131071 <rootless user>

To use Docker, the Docker daemon must be running as root. To automatically
start the Docker daemon at boot:
  rc-update add docker default

To use Docker as a non-root user, add yourself to the 'docker' group:
  usermod -aG docker <youruser>

Install additional packages for optional runtime features:
  sys-apps/rootlesskit for rootless mode support
for rootless mode you also need a network stack
  app-containers/slirp4netns for rootless mode network stack
