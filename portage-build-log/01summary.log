Note: Even though you have successfully unmerged 
your kernel package, directories in kernel source location: 
/usr/src/linux-6.6.74-gentoo
with modified files will remain behind. By design, package managers
will not remove these modified files and the directories they reside in.

WARN: postinst
Some software with pre-loaded PAM libraries might experience
warnings or failures related to missing symbols and/or versions
after any update. While unfortunate this is a limit of the
implementation of PAM and the software, and it requires you to
restart the software manually after the update.

You can get a list of such software running a command like
  lsof / | grep -E -i 'del.*libpam\.so'

Alternatively, simply reboot your system.
