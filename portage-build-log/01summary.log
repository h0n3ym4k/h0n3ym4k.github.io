LOG: postinst
On many systems, especially amd64, it is typical that with a modern
toolchain -fomit-frame-pointer for gcc is the default, because
debugging is still possible thanks to gcc/gdb location list feature.
However sysprof is not able to construct call trees if frame pointers
are not present. Therefore -fno-omit-frame-pointer CFLAGS is suggested
for the libraries and applications involved in the profiling. That
means a CPU register is used for the frame pointer instead of other
purposes, which means a very minimal performance loss when there is
register pressure.

NOTE: Above message is only printed the first time package is
installed or if the message changed. Please look at
/usr/share/doc/sysprof-47.2-r1/README.gentoo
for future reference.
