# Self Introduction
>All of my skills mentioned are hands-on experience. And yes, I am technical. At least I am confident in my own technical knowledge as an asset to me.
I am passionate about computer stuff as you read through my history. And I am a progressive learner as IT technologies are evolving all the time.
As a computer guy, I like to utilize my brain as logic analyzer rather than hard coding specific steps or routines of doing some tasks. That does not mean I cannot live with routines. I perform computer-related routines mostly by scripting. If that is not possible, I write script on paper so my brain will run it so to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of doing my routines manually.

>I was the chairman of computer society when I was F.6. It was one of the largest society having around 160 members. I was the leader for the homepage building team of my secondary school. I was helping out the school to setup network and computer lab using MS products, e.g. NT4 workstation and server, Win2k pro and adv server, Proxy 2 server, IIS, RedHat 7 and 8 as Web, FTP, Email server.

>I further studied about computer-related subjects after my secondary school. I entered computer competitions, namely HK Youth Skills Competition - PC & Network Supporter, and I was the 1st runner-up. I was one of the representative of HK for the Guangzhou, HK, Macau Youth Skills Competition.

>I am a hobbyist for open source environment. I use Gentoo Linux for my laptop and server. I host my own web, ftp, email, dns server. I tackle problems range from end-user level to security engineering level. I also touch on electronic stuff, e.g. basic circuit soldering and little knowledge about electronic components.

>I am a person who can communicate effectively. I was a corporate level customer support for an ISP when I was 19, though I need to perform system and network troubleshooting tasks.
I am able to write in a readable manner as I published once an article about Gentoo Linux in a local computer magazine (E-zone).

>For myself, my English is better than my Chinese.
I like playing various kinds of computer games, reading books and docs and even lines of code during my leisure time.
I was a full-time volunteer worked in Crossroads International as furniture refurbishment work and furniture movement and warehouse storage space arrangement work.
I am a committee for a local Linux users group, Hong Kong Linux Player Group. I was one of the phone support about general platform migration for local SMEs, e.g. data migration issues, costing issues. I was one of the helper setting up the security conference and contest environment in HKCEC using various Linux platforms and Cisco equipment.
I am a certified by EC-Council as Computer Hacking Forensic Investigator since 2006.
I am RHCE since 2014. I am ISC2 SSCP since 2018.
